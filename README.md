[00:00.94] Saved from eternal dreams
[00:07.13] Like the kings and queens in fables of old
[00:15.78] Stir now from an endless sleep
[00:22.02] Let the children weep for your embrace
[00:41.02] 
[00:29.76] Return to me and break this heart of stone
[00:36.29] Show me that it's time to bring you home
[00:44.94] Turn the key to cast away the veil
[00:52.09] We're dying to see you
[00:55.86] So don't let me fail
[01:05.86] 
[01:00.57] Still like a figurine
[01:07.02] You were so serene
[01:09.98] As leaves turned to gold
[01:14.88] So sail back to the distant shores
[01:22.20] For the world adores
[01:24.91] It pines for you
[01:32.91] 
[01:29.50] Return to me and break this heart of stone
[01:36.33] Show me that it's time to bring you home
[01:44.79] Turn the key to cast away the veil
[01:52.06] We're dying to see you
[01:55.72] So don't let me fail
[02:05.72] 
[02:03.83] Rejoice
[02:06.45] Finally the day will come
[02:11.10] To be back with an angel
[02:18.62] Rejoice
[02:21.55] Finally the day will come
[02:26.00] We can meet again
[02:29.95] We can meet again
[02:38.45] 
[02:34.73] Hope that was almost gone
[02:40.78] Like a dwindled flame
[02:43.62] You're near once again
[02:48.63] True kindness long ago we lost
[02:55.63] Had to get it back and face the cost
